9. [Office 365 University](http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-office-365-university-FX102918415.aspx) Four Year Subscription
	- I'll feel it absurd that most Chinese pirate Microsoft Office; well, if them buy Mac, iWork is free and good to use; if all of them notice this issue, Office will not be the all industry standard as well as pirate Office as the all industry standard; so given the amount of Chinese Office users (most of them pirate), Chinese pirating Office is a way to keep Microsoft Office survive in the world against its competitors... To be honest, you, especially programmers, can say Office has a long history has many professional features that are unknown to ordinary people. Come out, it's an ordinary people's world! A product doesn't make features simple, easy, accessible and friendly, it doesn't deserve to survive. And Office is so uncomfortable and least enjoyable for me to use! Though, I still pay for it!
10. [Xunlei platinum](http://vip.xunlei.com/client/) 迅雷白金客户端...

	- It doesn't upload your files to the cloud/server; Dropbox does
4. [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
	- To show installed Cygwin package, run `cygcheck -c`; notably I installed `aria2`, `base-cygwin`, `bash`, `bzip2`, `coreutils`, `cygwin`, `grep`, `gzip` and `sed`; I'm not a expert so I don't know the dependencies among them, what I can remember is that I installed Cygwin only to use `aria2`.

	- use only keyboard for Windows Explorer
17. [MacType](https://code.google.com/p/mactype/)
	- a Chinese font rendering engine based on a Japanese project
	- You can get best setting files at [极限社区](http://bbs.themex.net/); I have two accounts at the forum before, one of them bought from Taobao, but now I forgot the password and the account name; damn, why the forum guys keep the settings as a secret? I believe the best ever original MacType setting is out of ordinary people's reach; so I will definitely pay somebody who can get (Chinese and English) font rendering perfected on my Win computer, but I cannot find such guy online :(

19. [MPC-BE](http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=165890)

	- free text expander; not sure why it is still here; will decide later to delete it or not
24. [Picasa 3](http://picasa.google.com/)

	- plain paste
26. [SharpKeys](http://sharpkeys.codeplex.com/)
	- Key remapping
27. [Skitch](http://evernote.com/skitch/)
28. [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) (I hold no subscription now)
	- Previously I got 4.99/mo through UNiDAYS and then I stop listening music for two months or so. Then thinking it a waste of money, so I cancelled it but discovered later I can't get 4.99/mo any more which now I consider a good price. Kinda regret, anyway when I get my first salary, I'd like to pay 9.99/mo for it.
29. [TeraCopy](http://codesector.com/teracopy)
	- Copy large files faster; slower if files are small
30. [TeX Live 2013](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)

## Games

- I don't play them all. I'll say the only game I have played (I'm not saying playing a lot) is Diablo III Original. And among the games I played (actually one, doing this will show accuracy), the ones I played a lot is Diablo III Original. If I discovered the real money auction house earlier, I would have had all my characters upgraded to Lv. 60 earlier.
- I didn't play games a lot since the year before leaving junior school; it's a makeup to the old times; hopefully, I will play games for wise purpose.
- The dark side: I bought the games because I want them **available** for me though I may not even play them at all.
- Some games I bought but not installed on x51 because I don't like them after purchase. I put them here only to back up the game list, that's all. I may delete them afterwards.

- Assassin'S Creed III
- Batman Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition
- Batman Arkham City GOTY
- Diablo III Original
- Diablo III Reaper of Souls
	- Paragon Lv. 6
	- Barbarian Lv. 67
	- Crusader Lv. 56
	- Demon Hunter Lv. 60
	- Monk Lv. 60
	- Witch Doctor Lv. 60
	- Wizard Lv. 60
- DmC Devil May Cry
- Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City
	- I couldn't open the game and Steam didn't refund, damn!
- Mass Effect 3
- Might & Magic Heroes VI
	- Chinese version is much cheapter than English one, sad...

### Games Wishlist

- Grand Theft Auto V PC Version

- 信長の野望シリーズ
	- I did play pirate versions before; hope I will learn Japanese and pay Japan a visit someday
- Some says PC games are for gays; okay... I'll buy PS4, XBOX, etc. game systems someday and hopefully play the games wisely...

## Win positioning

网上流传：

- Win 资本主义
- OS X 帝国主义
- Linux 共产主义

但我觉得：

- Win 共产主义 盗版
- OS X 资本主义；对于系统本身，设计者考虑很周全 +1；完善的正版制度，吸引开发者开发出 GUI 友好且有时相对高效的 apps
- Linux 共济会好吗...

反正我作为非程序员，只稍系统地美化过 Win, 中二地 OS 去 GUI 化地用过 Arch Linux (中二程度有限和智商有限，不能玩到 Gentoo 和 Linux From Scratch, 抱歉...), 大量地买过 OS X apps 地正在用着 OS X, 适量地买过 Win apps 和游戏地用过 Win；综上，我 troll level -like. 但是我没觉得 Mac 有优越到非得干死所有敌人的地步，因为我用 Linux 时就是觉得 Linux 和 GNU Project 有优越到尤其要干死 Mac 的地步，黑黑得白，负负得正，所以我是中立的，现在如果看见果粉欺负微软用户我仍然要上去去打脸的，嗯。OS 前后顺序: Win XP - Win Vista 台式 & Win Vista (正版; 第一个笔记本大一才有有木有，世界第一个超级本, Dell Adamo; 所以寝室全升了 Win 7 时我坚守 Vista) - Win 7 - Ubuntu - Arch Linux (其间用过 Gnome, XFCE, LXDE, KDE, 最后还是 Openbox 符合中二特质) - Win 8 - 第二台笔记本 rmbp with OS X Mountain Lion - OS X Mavericks - 买了 Alienware X51，第一台自己的台式有米有，升了 Win 8.1 - 有段时间是 rmbp 和 x51 双开，但是台式噪音在看文献时始终忍不了，之后大段是单开，现在 resit Stata essay 又要双开了（真丢脸。。。

额，再提一下，我有个爱好就是买软件（话外音：“纯装b嘛明明可以不花钱为什么要装大款”; 好吧我不需要通过买软件来... u know），而且觉得软件作为工具，跟其他吃的穿的住的比，真的是好便宜... 买那些的人才是有钱人好嘛；那些东西我在不确定其事实上的社会心理功用前，我都不舍花钱买好嘛

我真的情商为负...
