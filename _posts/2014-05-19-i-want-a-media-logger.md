As a person spent time at home for the most time (I would say for the time being), I may need to put (or release?) more control on myself. I have meals with media. Sometimes it could be inefficient or less efficient for my timetable. I could have arial2c download media (TV plays, movies, or learning stuff) for me. An improvement would be I buy a little screen for my Alienware X51 and let X51 execute downloading tasks. However, the problem is I will leave the UK in 5 months and the monitors need to be disposed. Secondly I don't have so many things to download. This kind of tasks may be boosted if I accelerate the learning speed and insulate the disturbance like this imagining. It's contradiction anyway.

The second step would be related to time logger. I could make two buttons in Launch Centre Pro (iOS) to set up the starting time and the end time, and have arial2c (OS X) to pass the filename (I need to assure the name show what the content is about - so a naming system may be deployed) through Command-C (OS X) to Drafts (iOS).

The third step would be record reflection. I could decide what to watch (if it's learning stuff but interesting enough to make me relaxed; then object == learning stuff; then I would call it a schedule as part of project management) based on some sorts of feedbacks I could 'feel about'.

Because I eat and sleep quite randomly, I mean, I could have breakfast in the afternoon, or dinner in midnight, or dinner in the early morning, sometimes I just don't sleep. I really need this kind of logging to show what I have been doing.

A point to mention is I don't like unnecessary things. For example, I don't care about how fancy Day One looks like. Instead I'd like to put more control the data of me so I can change the form and visualise the data at my will. At least, these should be plain texts and essential divider for possible regex use; or better, XML. But I know nothing about database right now. Wish I know them in the future.
