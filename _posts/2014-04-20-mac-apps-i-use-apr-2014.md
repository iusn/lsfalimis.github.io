## Often

- [MacTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/) I love LaTeX more than any other markup languages. I use package **amsmath** for beautiful equations, **booktabs** for professional tables, **beamer** for presentation slides, and **pgfplots** and **tikz** for figures that have same rendering as the body texts of LaTeX. LaTeX also have overlapping features like TextExpander (use `\newcommand` and `\renewcommand` to expand texts and commands instead of TextExpander can increase readability), and Scrivener (you can use `\input{chapter.tex}` to divide your dissertation into several files and load them in Sublime Text's tabs). Besides, you can [download](http://www.latextemplates.com/) elegant templates for your essays and cover pages.

- [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) I cannot image the life without 1Password!

- [Alfred 2 with Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/) Workflows saves me time. [Examples](https://github.com/hzlzh/Alfred-Workflows) and the [full list](http://alfredworkflow.com/). Besides, I use it as a calculator and dictinary (it can help me spell - I'm not a native speaker), which makes me look like not smart and lazy, but I don't care...

- [EuDic](http://www.eudic.net/eudic/mac_dictionary.aspx) Spotlight-like dictionary, quite handy

- [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) A power app in workflows

- [Chrome](http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/browser/) Love its GUI, love its simplicity, no need to tweak, already fast. Extensions I installed includes [Adblock Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb), [Better History](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obciceimmggglbmelaidpjlmodcebijb), [Copy as Markdown](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fkeaekngjflipcockcnpobkpbbfbhmdn), [Don't track me Google](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gdbofhhdmcladcmmfjolgndfkpobecpg), [Evernote Web Clipper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pioclpoplcdbaefihamjohnefbikjilc), [musiXmatch](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gfenjblodoldnbiddmggcbkcapiolbig)(just for fun, actually never use it), [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)(some userscripts not working well, long time disabled and I use bookmarklets instead), [ToggleLink: Select Text From Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pihmbjnaeenimjokcejnenhppigofjdi), [Vanilla Cookie Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gieohaicffldbmiilohhggbidhephnjj), [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb)(Vimperator/Pentadactyl on Chrome; can be turned off for individual websites)

- [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/) Powerhouse of my Mac automation, my favourite app! A practical [example](http://readful.com/post/77044128470/keyboard-maestro-appstore) that uses KM to switch iTunes/Mac App Store accounts

- [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/) Popular alternative to stock Terminal

- [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/) Popular PDF viewer alternative to stock Preview

- [SnappyApp](http://snappy-app.com/) Take a screenshot and pin it to the top of screen, my second favourite app

- [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) I paid it and use it most often among all Mac apps I installed. A great tool to increase text editing productivity. Still learning it

- [TextExpander](https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/) My third favourite app



## Sometimes

- [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/) A cool window manager that let you dictate what location and size you want windows to be

- [GitHub](https://mac.github.com/) There are massive Git documents and for some people like me they are too complex and not clear (poorly documented?)

- [LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/) as an app launcher seems to be replaced by hyper key, see the [guide](http://lucifr.com/2013/02/16/caps-lock-to-hyper-key/)

- [MailMate](http://freron.com/) Still in trial, a seemingly fully customisable IMAP mail client that uses less CPU, memory resources

- [MindNode Pro](https://mindnode.com/) A clean mindmap app

- [Movist](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/movist/id461788075?mt=12) VLC needs time investment which I don't like.

- [PDFNut](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pdfnut/id588109295?mt=12) Tabbed PDF viewer, looks pretty

- [PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) Love its extensions. Set a shortcut for it, see the [guide](http://lucifr.com/2013/06/26/invoke-popclip-via-keyboard/)

## For fun

- [4K Stogram](http://www.4kdownload.com/products/product-stogram) Batch download Instagram

## For study

- [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/digital-editions.html) I need this to lend DRM-protected PDF ebooks.

- [Papers](http://www.papersapp.com/mac/) So far works good with BibTeX



## Background Apps

- [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com/) Hide menu bar icons

- [BetterSnapTool](http://blog.boastr.net/bettersnaptool/) Window management

- [Dropshelf](https://pilotmoon.com/dropshelf/) A file placeholder at side of the screen

- [iStat Menus](http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) Show me the temperature and network speed

- [KeyRemap4MacBook](https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/) Create hyper key

- [Little Snitch](http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/) 'firewall', sniff dangers

- [PCKeyboardHack](https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/pckeyboardhack.html.en) Remap the caps lock key and some other keys!

- [picatext](http://www.picatext.com/) Instant OCR. Yes, I'm lazy!

- [Timing](http://timingapp.com/) I started to logging everything when I'm on OS X or iOS, so the app is a must.

- [XMenu](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/freeware.html) A windows 'file' start-menu-like on the menu bar, very useful; sometimes, it's too tired to type



## Seldom

- [Better Rename 9](http://www.publicspace.net/ABetterFinderRename/)

- [BookReader](http://macbookreader.com/)

- [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) Markdown editor

- [Calca](http://calca.io/) so-called 'symbolic calculator' that uses Markdown

- [CheatSheet](http://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/) Note: choose the webiste version

- [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) Maybe it's too popular and I don't use it? Or its GUI is too 'Impact-font-like'? Dropbox and plain texts are good for me and ST3's manipulation.

- [ExpanDrive](http://www.expandrive.com/) A good app but still waiting for chances to use it...

- [Hourly News](http://hourlynewsapp.com/) No good source recommendation so not use it much

- [iBooks](http://www.apple.com/uk/ibooks/)

- [Scapple](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scapple.php) Still waiting for chances to use it...

- [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) Again... Not easy to use or maybe learn (why should I learn software? Instead, knowledge is the focus, right?), and hard to guess what it is for

- [Ulysses](http://www.ulyssesapp.com/) ST3 is so efficient and lure me to use it and drop others, for example Ulysses.

- [XtraFinder](http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/) I have tried TotalFinder and bought the most expensive Path Finder. And for me, XtraFinder is the fastest of the three, simplicity fits functionality.



## For Windows

- [BitTorrent Sync](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync)



## Old Apps

- [iBooks Author](http://www.apple.com/uk/ibooks-author/) to create hundreds of pages of product catalogues



## Never
- [Microsoft Office 2011](https://www.microsoft.com/uk/mac) I have to say the fonts is all I what, it will save time when you open Office files using iWork. Office cannot render equations but iWork can. So my default apps to open Office files are iWork.

- [ScreenFlow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) Just got it from MacHeist
