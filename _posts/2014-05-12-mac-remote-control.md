I have been wishing to get an Apple Remote because I like the design of every Apple gadgets. However, there is no IR Sensor in retina Macbook Pro and so the function Apple Remote will bring.

[BetterTouchTool](http://www.boastr.net/) has an iOS companion and I haven't checked the app till today. To add a remote control for an app is quite easy.

Though its iOS app [BTT Remote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/btt-remote/id561676304?mt=8) is an paid app, I will say it grants much possibilities to remote Mac workflows.

I have been using Air Video HD (Mac & iOS) for a while, when I need some entertainment during dinner. A few days ago, yet Air Video HD couldn't connect to the Air Video HD server on my Mac. So BTT Remote will be a backup if Air Video HD gets into trouble.

On iOS, tap an app will launch the app on Mac (quite convenient!)

Then, I will access the commands I set up on Mac. It also have a mini Trackpad which automatically enlarges the mouse on my 24" external monitor. From the app list screen, I can go to my sidebar, which acts like a playlist.

Swipe left and I can control the light (I need to dim the screen when watching TV plays) and volumes. And swipe right and I can perform double click which can't been done within individual app control.
